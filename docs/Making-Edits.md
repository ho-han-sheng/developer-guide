# Making Edits

## Branching

You may wish to refer to `17:02` in the [first video we mentioned](https://youtu.be/8Dd7KRpKeaE?t=1022) for a quick overview on what branching is. 

> ‚ùó Always create a new branch before making any new changes locally, do not commit directly to `main`.

Here are the steps to creating a branch in GitHub Desktop:

1. On GitHub Desktop, go to `Branch` and click `New branch`.

2. Create a name for your new branch. Try to keep them descriptive and relevant to the edits you would be making.

3. Your current branch should now reflect your chosen name for the new branch.

## Content-Specific Edits

If you are here as a member of the social media sub-committee, the following sections will be of relevance to you. It is also time for you to start up your code editor!

### Visual Studio Code (VSCode / VSC) Extensions

The base installation of VSCode does not come with  functionalities specific to the programming language you use, this prevents unnecessarily downloads for features you don't need. Consequently, you need to install these extensions yourself. Fear not for VSCode has a relatively quick and simple installation process for them.

Suggested extensions:

- bungcip.better-toml
  - Provides syntax highlighting for `.toml` (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language) files
- rusnasonov.vscode-hugo
  - Allows you to locally build and host a `hugo` server
  - i.e., locally view your changes to the website without affecting the live website
- budparr.language-hugo-vscode
  - Provides syntax highlighting and snippets for `hugo` websites
- yzhang.markdown-all-in-one
  - Provides auto preview and other shortcuts for `.md` (Markdown) files
- DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint
  - Lint (a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs) for `.md` (Markdown) files
- natqe.reload
  - Provides a reload button on the bottom right of VSCode.
- tonybaloney.vscode-pets
  - Provides a virtual pet to keep you company when working in VSCode

Here are the steps for installing an extension in VSCode:

1. On the leftmost bar, select the extensions icon.

5. Repeat this process for the remaining extensions

6. Reload VSCode to ensure changes take effect. If you have installed `natqe.reload`, there will be a reload button on the bottom right.
